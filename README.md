## Introduction

üåç Welcome to the Life Expectancy Analysis project! This repository takes you on a journey through the captivating world of global health, all through the lens of data. üìä The project delves into a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse factors from over 190 countries, spanning from life expectancy and healthcare indicators to socio-economic variables. üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Let's dive into the exploration of how elements like immunization rates, adult mortality, economic prosperity, and more intertwine to shape the longevity of populations. üìà By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, the aim is to shine a light on the intricate interplay of these factors. üåü

## Objective

The objective of this GitHub project is to analyze and predict life expectancy in various countries using a comprehensive dataset. The aim is to understand the critical factors that influence life expectancy, including healthcare indicators, socio-economic factors, and immunization rates. The project will leverage data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning techniques to:

**Explore and clean** a rich dataset consisting of information on life expectancy, mortality rates, economic indicators, and more for 193 countries from the year 2000 to 2015.

**Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations among the variables, shedding light on the key factors impacting life expectancy.

**Develop predictive models**, including regression models and potentially machine learning algorithms, to forecast life expectancy based on the identified factors.

**Create insightful data visualizations** and interactive dashboards to communicate our findings and predictions effectively.

**Investigate specific research questions**, such as the relationship between healthcare expenditure and life expectancy, the impact of immunization coverage, and the influence of socioeconomic factors on a population's lifespan.

This GitHub project aims to contribute to the field of public health and data science by delivering actionable insights and models that can guide efforts to enhance life expectancy and well-being around the world. 

## Prerequisite 

To run this analysis, you need the following prerequisites:

Python 3

Jupyter Notebook (optional)

Pandas

Matplotlib (for data visualization)

Seaborn (for enhanced data visualization)

## Data Description

**Country:** This column contains the names of countries. It represents the country to which the data observation corresponds. Each row in the dataset represents a specific country.

**Year:** This column represents the year in which the data was recorded. It's an integer value that indicates the time period for each observation.

**Status:** The 'Status' column categorizes countries into different groups based on their development status. It classifies countries as either "Developed" or "Developing." This classification is important for comparing life expectancy and other factors between different types of countries.

**Life Expectancy:** This column contains the life expectancy values, which represent the average number of years a person is expected to live in a specific country during a given year. It's a crucial health indicator.

**Adult Mortality:** 'Adult Mortality' represents the probability of death between the ages of 15 and 60 per 1000 population. It provides insights into adult mortality rates.

**Infant Deaths:** This column records the number of infant deaths (children under one year of age) in a specific country during the given year. It's a critical indicator of child health and healthcare system effectiveness.

**Alcohol:** The 'Alcohol' column represents the average alcohol consumption per capita in a country, typically measured in litres of pure alcohol consumed per person per year. It's a health and lifestyle factor.

**Percentage Expenditure:** 'Percentage Expenditure' indicates the percentage of a country's total expenditure allocated to healthcare or related health expenditures. It reflects the financial commitment to healthcare.

**Hepatitis B:** 'Hepatitis B' represents the percentage of the population immunized against Hepatitis B. It's a measure of immunization coverage and disease prevention.

**Measles:** This column records the number of reported measles cases in a specific country during the given year. It reflects the prevalence of a vaccine-preventable disease.

**BMI (Body Mass Index):** 'BMI' may represent the average Body Mass Index for the population in a specific country. BMI is a measure of body weight relative to height and is linked to health and nutrition.

**Under-five deaths:** This column records the number of deaths among children under the age of five in a specific country during the given year. It's another critical child health indicator.

**Polio:** 'Polio' represents the percentage of the population immunized against Polio. It's another measure of immunization coverage.

**Total Expenditure:** This column represents the total healthcare expenditure as a percentage of a country's GDP or national income. It reflects the investment in healthcare.

**Diphtheria:** 'Diphtheria' is the percentage of the population immunized against Diphtheria, another immunization coverage measure.

**HIV/AIDS:** This column represents the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in a specific country during the given year. It's a critical health factor.

**GDP (Gross Domestic Product):** 'GDP' represents the economic output of a country. It's typically expressed in monetary terms (e.g., US dollars) and reflects a country's economic health.

**Population:** 'Population' represents the total population of a specific country during the given year. It's essential for understanding the scale of healthcare needs.

**Thinness 1-19 Years:** This column may represent the percentage of the population aged 1-19 years who are considered thin. It's an indicator of nutritional status.

**Thinness 5-9 Years:** Similar to the previous column, this may represent the percentage of the population aged 5-9 years who are considered thin.

**Income Composition of Resources:** This column could represent a composite index reflecting a country's income composition, potentially considering factors like income distribution and sources of income.

**Schooling:** 'Schooling' likely represents the average number of years of schooling or education received by individuals in a specific country. It's an indicator of educational attainment and its impact on health.
